# testcases-lab1-1

There is a one calculator.h file in which all the required function are implemented. There are four function for addition of 2 matrices, addition of 3 matrices, multiplication of 2 matrices and subtraction of 2 matrices. The arguments are passed on from the testcases.cpp file. After getting the arguments required operation are implemented.
In test cases.cpp file , I am reading the file which is having 3 matrices. I am basically using vectors to read the whole matrix as the size of the matrix was not known. Through vectors I read the whole file and stored the vectors into matrices. Then I created there 2D array so that I could work and apply operations easily.
Then I implemented the test cases given to us , which are
•	Multiply 2 matrices.
•	Add 3 matrices.
•	Multiply 2 matrices and then add a 3rdone to the result.
